# Availability Overlap Validation Feature

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Problem

The availability manager allowed agents to:

1. Add overlapping time slots (e.g., 09:00-18:00 and 09:00-12:00 on the same day)
2. Set end times before start times
3. This caused duplicate available time slots to appear in the appointment booking system

## Solution

### Frontend Validation (`AvailabilityManager.tsx`)

#### 1. Added Overlap Detection Helper Function

```typescript
const hasOverlappingSlots = (
  slots: { startTime: string; endTime: string }[]
): boolean => {
  // Converts time to minutes and checks if any slots overlap
  // Returns true if overlaps found
};
```

#### 2. Enhanced `addSlotToDay` Function

- Changed default new slot time from `09:00-12:00` to `14:00-17:00` (less likely to overlap)
- Validates new slot doesn't overlap with existing slots
- Shows error notification if overlap detected
- Prevents save if validation fails

#### 3. Enhanced `updateDaySlot` Function

- Validates start time is before end time
- Validates updated slot doesn't overlap with other slots
- Shows appropriate error messages
- Prevents save if validation fails

### Backend Fix (`appointmentController.ts`)

#### Fixed Duplicate Time Slots in `getAvailableSlots`

- Changed from array to `Set` to eliminate duplicates
- Sorts final slots chronologically
- Prevents duplicate hours appearing in reschedule modal

```typescript
// Before: const availableSlots: string[] = [];
// After: const availableSlotsSet = new Set<string>();
// Return: Array.from(availableSlotsSet).sort()
```

## Validation Rules

### Time Slot Validation

1. **Start < End**: Start time must be before end time
2. **No Overlaps**: Time slots on the same day cannot overlap
3. **Unique Slots**: Backend ensures no duplicate slots returned

### User Experience

- ❌ Error notification if overlap detected
- ❌ Error notification if start >= end time
- ✅ Clear error messages in French
- ✅ Prevents invalid data from being saved

## Files Modified

### Client

- `client/components/appointments/AvailabilityManager.tsx`
  - Added `hasOverlappingSlots()` helper function
  - Enhanced `addSlotToDay()` with validation
  - Enhanced `updateDaySlot()` with validation

### Server

- `server/src/controllers/appointmentController.ts`
  - Fixed `getAvailableSlots()` duplicate slot issue

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Validated Scenarios

1. Cannot add overlapping slots (e.g., 09:00-18:00 + 09:00-12:00)
2. Cannot set end time before start time
3. Cannot add slots that partially overlap
4. Duplicate backend slots are merged into single entries
5. Error messages displayed clearly to user

### Edge Cases Handled

- Adjacent slots (09:00-12:00, 12:00-18:00) ✅ Allowed
- Identical slots (09:00-12:00, 09:00-12:00) ❌ Blocked
- Partial overlaps (09:00-13:00, 12:00-18:00) ❌ Blocked
- Multiple slots with proper spacing ✅ Allowed

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Prevents invalid time slot configurations
2. **Better UX**: Clear error messages guide users to fix issues
3. **No Duplicates**: Backend returns unique time slots only
4. **Logical Defaults**: New slots start at 14:00 (less likely to conflict)
5. **Real-time Validation**: Errors shown immediately before save

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- Visual indicator showing which slots overlap
- Suggest available time ranges when adding new slots
- Merge adjacent slots automatically (e.g., 09:00-12:00 + 12:00-18:00 → 09:00-18:00)
- Batch validation when pasting/importing schedules
