### 4. ✅ Availability Manager Component (`client/components/appointments/AvailabilityManager.tsx`)

**Comprehensive availability management UI for agents:**

#### Weekly Schedule Configuration

- Multiple time slots per day support
- Add/remove time slots dynamically
- Time range inputs (start time - end time)
- Default business hours: 9AM-6PM Mon-Fri

#### General Settings

- **Default Duration**: Appointment length in minutes (15-180 min, step 15)
- **Buffer Time**: Gap between appointments (0-60 min, step 5)
- **Max Appointments Per Day**: Daily appointment limit (1-20)
- **Advance Booking Days**: How far ahead bookings allowed (1-90 days)

#### UI Features

### 5. ✅ Real-Time Notifications (`client/hooks/useAppointmentNotifications.ts`)

**Custom hook for Socket.IO-based real-time updates:**

#### Events Handled:

1. **appointment:new** - Agent receives new booking request
2. **appointment:status_updated** - Status changes (confirmed/rejected/cancelled/completed)
3. **appointment:cancelled** - Appointment cancellation
4. **appointment:rescheduled** - Appointment rescheduled

#### Notification Logic:

- **For Agents**:

  - New appointment requests from clients
  - Client cancellations

- **For Apporteurs**:
  - Appointment confirmed by agent
  - Appointment rejected by agent
  - Appointment cancelled by agent
  - Appointment rescheduled
  - Appointment completed

#### Features:

- Auto-refresh appointment lists via `onUpdate` callback
- French language notifications
- Different toast types (info/success/error/warning)
- Only shows notifications to relevant party
- Prevents duplicate notifications when user triggers action themselves

### 6. ✅ Dashboard Stats Integration

#### Agent Dashboard Overview

Added 3 appointment stats cards:

- **Pending Appointments** (cyan badge with calendar icon)
- **Confirmed Appointments** (emerald badge with checkmark icon)
- **Total Appointments** (indigo badge with clock icon)

#### Apporteur Dashboard Overview

Same 3 stats cards with matching styling

**Implementation:**

- `fetchAppointmentStats()` function fetches all appointments
- Calculates stats client-side from appointment array
- Updates on component mount
- Auto-refreshes via real-time notifications

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- Local component state for appointments, filters, loading states
- Custom hooks for auth, notifications, and appointments

### API Integration

All components use `appointmentApi` from `@/lib/api/appointmentApi.ts`:

- `getMyAppointments(params?)` - Fetch user's appointments with optional filters
- `updateAppointmentStatus(id, data)` - Update appointment status
- `getAgentAvailability(agentId)` - Get agent's availability settings
- `updateAgentAvailability(data)` - Save availability settings

### Real-Time Communication

- Socket.IO context from `@/context/SocketContext`
- Custom hook with useCallback for event handlers
- Auto-cleanup on unmount
- Dependency array includes all handlers

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Consistent color scheme:
  - Cyan: Pending/calendar actions
  - Emerald/Green: Confirmed/success states
  - Yellow: Active states
  - Red: Cancelled/error states
  - Indigo/Purple: Total/general stats
- Responsive grid layouts (1 col mobile, 2-3 cols tablet, 3-4 cols desktop)
- Shadow and hover effects for cards

## User Flows

### Agent Workflow

1. Navigate to Dashboard → Rendez-vous tab
2. See pending requests in stats card and list
3. Click "Accepter" to confirm or "Refuser" to reject
4. View confirmed appointments
5. Click "Gérer mes disponibilités" to configure schedule
6. Set weekly hours, block vacation dates, adjust settings
7. Save and return to appointments
8. Receive real-time toast when new appointments arrive

3. View all booked appointments with agent details
4. Filter by status if needed
5. Cancel appointments if necessary
6. Click "Prendre rendez-vous" to book new appointment

## Backend Requirements (Already Implemented)

- POST /api/appointments - Create appointment
- GET /api/appointments/my - Get user's appointments
- PATCH /api/appointments/:id/status - Update status
- GET /api/appointments/availability/:agentId - Get agent availability
- PATCH /api/appointments/availability - Update agent availability
- Socket.IO events emitted in controllers

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required:

- [ ] Agent can view pending appointments
- [ ] Agent can accept appointments (status updates)
- [ ] Agent can reject appointments
- [ ] Agent can cancel appointments
- [ ] Agent can configure weekly schedule
- [ ] Agent can block specific dates
- [ ] Agent can update availability settings
- [ ] Apporteur can view appointments
- [ ] Apporteur can cancel appointments
- [ ] Apporteur sees "Prendre rendez-vous" link
- [ ] Real-time notifications work when other party acts
- [ ] Appointment lists auto-refresh on socket events
- [ ] Stats cards show correct counts
- [ ] Dashboard overview stats update
- [ ] Filter buttons work correctly
- [ ] Empty states display properly

### Edge Cases to Test:

- [ ] No appointments yet (empty state)
- [ ] Agent with no availability configured (defaults to 9AM-6PM)
- [ ] Multiple time slots per day
- [ ] Blocked dates prevent bookings
- [ ] Socket disconnection/reconnection
- [ ] Rapid status changes
- [ ] Large number of appointments (100+)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Appointment Details Modal**: Click appointment to see full details
2. **Reschedule UI**: In-place rescheduling without cancelling
3. **Notes/Messages**: Add notes visible to both parties
4. **Calendar View**: Month/week calendar visualization
5. **Email Notifications**: Backup notification system
6. **SMS Reminders**: Day-before appointment reminders
7. **Recurring Appointments**: Support for regular meetings
8. **Appointment History**: Archive and analytics
9. **Export**: CSV export of appointment data
10. **Advanced Filters**: Date range, property, appointment type

## Performance Considerations

- Appointment lists use client-side filtering (fast for <1000 items)
- Stats calculated from fetched data (no separate API call)
- Real-time updates use Socket.IO (efficient)
- useCallback prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Loading states for all async operations

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels on icon buttons
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus states on interactive elements
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Screen reader friendly status indicators

## Documentation Updates

- ✅ Feature documentation created
- ✅ Component documentation inline
- ✅ API integration documented
- ✅ User flows documented
- ⏳ End-to-end testing guide (this file)

## Summary

All dashboard integration tasks completed successfully:

- ✅ Rendez-vous tabs added to both dashboards
- ✅ Agent appointment management with accept/reject
- ✅ Availability manager with full configuration
- ✅ Apporteur appointment viewing with cancel
- ✅ Real-time toast notifications with auto-refresh
